# 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT - API Keys Exposed

## 📅 Date: 2025-10-13
## 🔴 Severity: CRITICAL
## ✅ Status: KEYS REMOVED - ROTATION REQUIRED

---

## 📋 Incident Summary

Multiple API keys and credentials were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository in file `QUICK_COMMANDS.md` (commit `324ee74`).

**GitHub automatically detected and alerted about:**
1. Google API Key
2. Supabase Service Role Key

**Additional exposed secrets (also found):**
3. Database passwords
4. Redis passwords
5. SMTP/Resend API key
6. NextAuth secret
7. Sentry DSN
8. Bull Board token

---

## ✅ Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. **Keys Removed from Repository** ✅
- File: `QUICK_COMMANDS.md`
- All exposed keys replaced with placeholders
- Commit: `security: remove exposed API keys from QUICK_COMMANDS.md`
- Status: **COMPLETED**

---

## 🚨 REQUIRED ACTIONS (DO IMMEDIATELY!)

### **CRITICAL: Rotate All Compromised Keys**

Anyone with access to the public GitHub repository could have copied these keys. You MUST rotate (regenerate) all exposed keys immediately.

---

### 1. **Google API Key** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Rotate Now:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your current API key
3. Click **"Delete"** or **"Restrict"**
4. Click **"Create Credentials"** → **"API key"**
5. Copy the new key
6. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Why:** Exposed Google API key can lead to:
- Unauthorized use of Gemini AI
- Unexpected charges to your Google Cloud account
- Quota exhaustion

---

### 2. **Supabase Service Role Key** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Rotate Now:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/overbsbivbuevmyltyet/settings/api
2. Click **"Reset service_role secret"**
3. Confirm reset (⚠️ This will invalidate the old key)
4. Copy the new `service_role` key
5. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Why:** Service Role Key has **full database access** and can:
- Read/write/delete ANY data
- Bypass Row Level Security (RLS)
- Create/delete users
- Access sensitive information

**⚠️ THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL KEY TO ROTATE!**

---

### 3. **Database Password** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Rotate Now:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/overbsbivbuevmyltyet/settings/database
2. Click **"Reset database password"**
3. Copy the new password
4. Update connection strings:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:NEW_PASSWORD@aws-1-sa-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
   DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:NEW_PASSWORD@db.overbsbivbuevmyltyet.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
5. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables
   - Vercel → Environment Variables
   - Local `.env.production` file
6. **Redeploy Railway** to pick up new password

---

### 4. **Redis Password (Upstash)** 🟡 HIGH

**Rotate Now:**
1. Go to: https://console.upstash.com/redis/accepted-cobra-23421
2. Click **"Reset Password"** or **"Rotate Credentials"**
3. Copy new password
4. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `REDIS_PASSWORD` & `REDIS_URL`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Note:** Redis is currently using MockRedis (emergency fix), so impact is minimal. But rotate anyway for security.

---

### 5. **Resend SMTP Password** 🟡 HIGH

**Rotate Now:**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Find current API key
3. Click **"Delete"**
4. Click **"Create API Key"**
5. Copy new key
6. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `SMTP_PASSWORD`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Why:** Exposed SMTP key can:
- Send emails on your behalf
- Use up your sending quota
- Send spam using your domain

---

### 6. **NextAuth Secret** 🟡 HIGH

**Rotate Now:**
1. Generate new secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
2. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - Vercel → Environment Variables → `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Why:** NextAuth secret is used to:
- Sign JWT tokens
- Encrypt session cookies
- If compromised, attacker can forge authentication tokens

**⚠️ NOTE:** Rotating this will **log out all users**. They'll need to log in again.

---

### 7. **Bull Board Access Token** 🟢 MEDIUM

**Rotate Now:**
1. Generate new token:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
2. Update in:
   - Railway → Environment Variables → `BULL_BOARD_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - Local `.env.production` file

**Why:** Bull Board token protects the queue monitoring dashboard. Not critical since workers are disabled, but rotate for good practice.

---

### 8. **Sentry DSN** 🟢 LOW

**Action:** Monitor for unauthorized usage

Sentry DSN is less critical as it's only used for sending error reports. However:
1. Go to: https://justoai.sentry.io/settings/projects/
2. Monitor for suspicious activity
3. If suspicious events, regenerate DSN

---

## 📊 Rotation Checklist

Use this checklist to track your key rotation progress:

```
🔴 CRITICAL (Do First):
[ ] Supabase Service Role Key rotated
[ ] Database password rotated
[ ] Google API Key rotated
[ ] Railway redeployed with new keys
[ ] Vercel redeployed with new keys
[ ] Tested: Login still works
[ ] Tested: Database connections work
[ ] Tested: API calls work

🟡 HIGH (Do Next):
[ ] Resend SMTP password rotated
[ ] NextAuth Secret rotated (⚠️ logs out users)
[ ] Redis password rotated
[ ] All services working after rotation

🟢 MEDIUM/LOW (Optional):
[ ] Bull Board token rotated
[ ] Sentry DSN monitored
```

---

## 🔧 Post-Rotation Steps

### 1. **Update Railway**
```bash
# Railway automatically redeploys when you change env vars
# Just verify it's running after rotation
```

### 2. **Update Vercel**
```bash
# If you changed NEXTAUTH_SECRET or other frontend vars:
vercel env pull
vercel --prod  # Redeploy
```

### 3. **Test Everything**
- [ ] Visit: https://justoai-v2.vercel.app
- [ ] Try to login
- [ ] Check if dashboard loads
- [ ] Verify API calls work
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Test signup (create new account)

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures (Already Implemented)

### ✅ Implemented
- [x] `.env.production` in `.gitignore`
- [x] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [x] Placeholders used in documentation files
- [x] Security warnings added to docs

### 🔄 Ongoing
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Key rotation every 90 days
- [ ] Monitor GitHub security alerts
- [ ] Review commits before pushing

---

## 📚 Security Best Practices

### **DO:**
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Keep `.env*` files in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use placeholders in documentation
- ✅ Rotate keys every 90 days
- ✅ Use different keys for dev/staging/prod
- ✅ Monitor for unauthorized usage
- ✅ Enable 2FA on all services

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Commit real API keys to Git
- ❌ Share `.env` files
- ❌ Use production keys in development
- ❌ Hardcode secrets in code
- ❌ Put secrets in GitHub Issues/PRs
- ❌ Store secrets in documentation

## 📧 Questions?

2. Contact service provider support
3. Consult with security team if available

**Remember:** It's better to rotate a key unnecessarily than to leave a compromised key active.
