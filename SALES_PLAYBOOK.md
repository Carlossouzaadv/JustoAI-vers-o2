## 1. ICP & Qualification Framework

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

```
Primary ICP: "Small Law Firm Decision-Maker"
├─ Título: Sócio, partner, gestor administrativo
├─ Firma: 5–20 advogados
├─ Faturamento: R$500K–5M/ano
├─ Location: São Paulo, Rio, Minas Gerais
├─ Case Volume: 30–50 new cases/month
├─ Pain: Custo JUDIT alto, análise lenta, escalação difícil
├─ Budget Authority: Sim (decisão rápida)
├─ Tech Savviness: Média (não precisa ser dev)
└─ Timeline: 2–4 semanas (rápido)

ICP Score:
├─ All 5 points: 🟢 SELL HARD (80%+ close rate)
├─ 4–3 points: 🟡 TRY (40–60% close rate)
├─ <3 points: 🔴 SKIP (10–20% close rate, low CAC efficiency)
```

### BANT Qualification Framework

**Budget:**
- "How much do you currently spend on legal tech monthly?" (look for R$500+)
- "What's your annual spend on JUDIT specifically?" (look for R$5K+)
- Confirmation: "You have budget to invest in solutions?"

**Authority:**
- "Who else would be involved in this decision?" (fewer people = faster)
- "Are you the decision-maker for tool purchases?" (need a yes)
- "What's your typical approval process?" (understand timeline)

**Need:**
- "What's your biggest pain point right now?" (listen for cost, speed, scale)
- "How much time does analysis take per case?" (50+ hours/month = qualified)
- "Have you looked at other solutions?" (shows urgency)

**Timeline:**
- "When would you need something like this?" (30 days = hot lead)
- "What triggers your urgency?" (deadline, pain becoming unbearable)
- "Are you in active buying mode?" (yes = qualified)

**Qualification Scoring:**
```
Pass (proceed to demo):
├─ Budget: "We have R$500/mth to spend"
├─ Authority: "I'm the decision-maker"
├─ Need: "We spend 40 hours/month on analysis"
└─ Timeline: "We'd like to implement in 30 days"

Fail (nurture pipeline):
├─ "We need to consult with partners first" → Schedule follow-up
├─ "Maybe next quarter" → Add to drip campaign
├─ "JUDIT works fine" → Challenge assumption
└─ "Can't spend right now" → Offer free trial
```

## 2. Cold Outreach Strategy

### Cold Email Sequence (3 emails + 1 call)

#### Email 1: Personalization + Problem (Day 1)

```
Subject: JUDIT costs you R$20K? [Name of Firm]

Hi [Sócio Name],

I was looking at [Firm Name] and noticed you handle a lot of
[specific case type] cases.

I found that most firms your size spend R$20K–50K/year on JUDIT
and another 40+ hours/month analyzing documents manually.

We built JustoAI to solve exactly that—analyze cases in 30 seconds
and reduce JUDIT costs by 96%.

Thought you might find it useful.

No pressure, just wanted to put it on your radar.

[Your name]
[Link: 2-min demo video]

---

Why this works:
├─ Specific: Mentions their firm + case type
├─ Data: Shows they're "typical" pain
├─ Solution: What we do (2 sentences max)
├─ CTA: Low pressure ("no pressure")
└─ Proof: Video (show don't tell)
```

#### Email 2: Social Proof + Objection Handling (Day 3–4, if no reply)

```
Subject: Re: JUDIT costs you R$20K? [Follow-up]

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note about JustoAI—thought you might
have missed it.

One quick thing: I just helped [Similar Firm Name] reduce their
JUDIT costs by R$250K/year and cut analysis time from 6 hours to
30 minutes per case.

They now handle 2x more cases with the same team.

Would a quick 15-minute call make sense to see if it could work
for [Your Firm]?

[Calendly link]

[Your name]

---

Why this works:
├─ Social proof: Real case (anonymized)
├─ Numbers: Specific R$ and time savings
├─ Low CTA: "15 minutes" (easy to say yes)
└─ Authority: You've done this before
```

#### Email 3: Urgency + Last Touch (Day 7, if no reply)

```
Subject: Last thing—and then I'll stop

Hi [Name],

I promised I wouldn't bother you, but this one's important:

We're doing a limited free trial for firms in [City] this month
(10 spots only). Normally R$699/mth, but trialists pay $0 for 30d.

After 30 days, you keep the same price if you decide to stay
(no price hike after trial).

Interested in one of the 10 spots?

[Calendly link]

[Your name]

---

Why this works:
├─ Scarcity: "10 spots only" (creates urgency)
├─ Value: "30d free" (low barrier)
├─ Price lock: "same price if you stay" (removes risk)
└─ Final CTA: Calendar link (easy yes)
```

#### Phone Call: The Pitch (If they don't respond)

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your name] from JustoAI.

I've been trying to reach you about that email I sent.
Do you have literally 60 seconds?

I help law firms like yours reduce JUDIT costs 96% and analyze
cases 100x faster using AI. We just launched and are offering
30 days free to firms in your area.

Makes sense to learn more?"

→ If yes: Schedule 15-min demo
→ If "not now": "When would be better?"
→ If "not interested": Ask why (qualm handling)
```

### Outreach Metrics & Goals

```
100 outreach attempts/month
├─ 10% response rate (10 replies)
├─ 50% interested (5 demos booked)
├─ 50% show up (2.5 actual demos)
├─ 30% trial sign (0.75 trials/attempts)
└─ 30% closed (0.2 customers/attempts = 20/100)
    = 20 customers/month from cold

Year 1: 240 customers from outreach
CAC for outreach: R$2.000–3.000 (sales cost)
```

## 3. Discovery Call (15 minutes)

### Agenda & Script

```
[0–2 min] Rapport
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I know your time is
valuable so I'll keep this brief.

Quick question: Are you currently shopping for a solution or just
exploring?"

[2–6 min] Pain Discovery
"What's your biggest pain point with managing cases right now?"
[Listen for: time, cost, compliance, scale]

"And if you could solve one problem, what would it be?"

"How much time do you currently spend on analysis per case?"

[6–10 min] Our Solution
"We built JustoAI exactly for that. In 30 seconds:
1. Upload your case
2. AI analyzes it (parties, claim value, risks, timeline)
3. We fetch official data from courts automatically
4. You get a full case profile + recommendations

Most firms we work with save R$250K/year in JUDIT costs alone."

[10–15 min] Next Steps
"Does this sound interesting enough to take a quick look?"

If yes:
"Perfect. How does next Tuesday at 2pm work for a 20-minute demo?"
[Send calendar invite]

If not sure:
"No problem. Here's a 2-minute video of it in action.
Could you watch and we'll check in next week?"
[Send video link]

If no:
"Got it. If anything changes, let me know. Happy to reconnect
down the road."
[Add to nurture]
```

### Objection Handling (In Discovery)

**Objection: "We already use [Kekanto/Jurify/Excel]"**
```
Response: "Cool, I'm not trying to replace that. Most firms use
multiple tools.

The question is: Does [Tool] give you analysis + JUDIT integration?
Probably not.

JustoAI is *specifically* for intelligent case analysis. We often
work *alongside* your existing tools."
```

**Objection: "JUDIT works fine for us"**
```
Response: "I hear that. Let me ask: How much are you spending on JUDIT
per month?

[Listen: R$800–R$5K typical]

And how much time does your team spend analyzing cases daily?

[Listen: 2–8 hours typical]

What if I told you we reduce both by 96%? Would that be interesting?"
```

**Objection: "Your price is high"**
```
Response: "I understand. Here's how we think about it:

Average firm saves R$250K/year in JUDIT costs + 200 hours in labor.

Our cost: R$699/month = R$8.4K/year.

Net savings: R$241.6K first year.

ROI: 2,800%.

Does that change your perspective?"
```

---

## 4. Product Demo (20–30 minutes)

### Demo Flow

```
[0–3 min] Setup
"I'm going to show you JustoAI in action using a real case
from your practice area. Ready?"

[3–5 min] The Problem
"Today, analyzing a case takes 4–6 hours. Manually."
[Show Excel spreadsheet, PDF, email chaos]

[5–8 min] The Solution Intro
"Watch what happens when you upload a document..."
[Upload PDF → Show 2-second analysis]

"In 2 seconds, we extract:
- Parties
- Claim value
- Case subject
- Last court movements
- And more"

[8–12 min] JUDIT Integration
"But here's the kicker: We automatically fetch official data
from the courts."
[Show JUDIT data + timeline merge]

"See how we merged the PDF with court data? That's 2 hours of
manual work, done automatically."

[12–15 min] AI Analysis
"And finally, strategic analysis."
[Run FULL analysis]

"For 1 credit, you get:
- Legal risk assessment
- Precedent analysis
- Timeline projection
- Next steps recommended

Takes 30 seconds. Usually takes 2–3 hours."

[15–20 min] Q&A
"Questions so far?"

[20–25 min] Pricing + Trial
"Here's our pricing:
- Starter: R$199 (1 user)
- Professional: R$699 (5 users)
- Enterprise: Custom

We offer 30 days free (no credit card required).

After 30 days, you get billed on day 31. But 80% of people who
try it, keep it."

[25–30 min] Next Steps
"Does this make sense? Should we get you set up for a trial?"

→ If yes: Schedule onboarding call
→ If "let me think": Send follow-up email with all info
→ If "maybe next quarter": "What would need to happen for you to
                           try it sooner?"
```

### Demo Tips

- **Never apologize** ("This might be slow...") — confidence sells
- **Listen more than you talk** — customer objections = gold
- **Show real data** — credibility > hype
- **Use their words** — "You mentioned time. Here's how we save time."
- **Close softly** — "Makes sense?" > hard close

Next Tuesday at 2pm?"

## 8. Sales Compensation & Goals

### Year 1 Commission Structure

```
VP Sales Role (hired Month 2):

Base Salary: R$7.000/month
Commission: 10% of first-year ARR

Example:
- Close 10 customers (Starter) = R$23.8K ARR
  → Commission: R$2.380

- Close 15 customers (Professional) = R$125.5K ARR
  → Commission: R$12.550

- Mix: 8 Starter + 12 Prof = 20 customers
  → ARR: R$102.288
  → Commission: R$10.229/month
  → Total comp: R$7K + R$10.2K = R$17.2K/month = R$187K/year

Alternative (no cap):
- Commission kicks in after R$10K MRR
- Afterward: 5% of all new MRR
- Unlimited upside
```

### Individual Sales Goals

```
Year 1 Targets:
├─ Month 1–3: 0 (hiring, training)

└─ Month 10–12: 15–20 customers (R$25–40K MRR)

Total Year 1: 50 customers

Break down by channel:
├─ Outbound (VP Sales): 40% = 20 customers
├─ Inbound (marketing): 30% = 15 customers
├─ Referrals: 20% = 10 customers
└─ Partnerships: 10% = 5 customers

## Success Stories & Case Studies

**Template to use with prospects:**

```
[Firm Name] reduced case analysis time from 6 hours to 30 minutes
using JustoAI. That's 15 cases/month per lawyer now instead of 5.

Plus: R$250K/year saved on JUDIT.

Bottom line: Same team, 3x more cases, 96% lower costs."

[Use real data from early customers]
```

---

**Sales is not pushiness. Sales is matching solutions to problems.

If JustoAI isn't right for someone, don't force it.
But if it is right, be confident and persistent.**
